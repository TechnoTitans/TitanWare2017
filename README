An Explanation of How Everything Works
==========================================================================

In src/org/usfirst/frc/team1683/ there are the following directories:

  * autonomous - controls the robot during its autonomous period
  * driverStation - screen that shows info about the robot
  * driveTrain - it's the drive train...
  * pickerUpper - the poor man's claw
  * pneumatics - everything air-related
  * robot - the main classes, because robots need to do robot stuff
  * sensors - self explanatory
  * shooter - a wheel shooter implementation
  * test - self-explanatory; not for a grade
  * vision - computer vision (deprecated; offloading to RasPi3 instead)
